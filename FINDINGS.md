# chuk_virtual_fs

A modular, pluggable virtual filesystem framework for Python, supporting multiple storage backends, security profiles, snapshot management, and templating.

---

## Overview

`chuk_virtual_fs` is a comprehensive virtual filesystem library designed to create and manage file and directory structures in memory or using various storage backends, including in-memory, SQLite, AWS S3, or Pyodide-native file systems.

It offers advanced features such as:

- Modular storage provider architecture
- Security wrappers with configurable sandboxing and resource limits
- Snapshot and restore capabilities for saving filesystem state
- Template loading and preloading for pre-populating filesystems
- Command-line interfaces for managing snapshots and templates

---

## Features

### Storage Providers

- **MemoryStorageProvider**: Fast in-memory filesystem.
- **SQLiteStorageProvider**: Persistent local storage using SQLite.
- **S3StorageProvider**: Cloud storage on AWS S3 buckets.
- **PyodideStorageProvider**: For use within Pyodide environments.
- Support for additional providers via plugin registration.

### Security Profiles

- Predefined profiles such as `default`, `strict`, `readonly`, `untrusted`, and `testing`.
- Enforce limits including max file size, total storage quota, path restrictions, denied patterns, read-only modes, and max path depth.
- Configurable path allowlists and denylists.
- Security violation logging.
- Sandbox wrapping of any storage provider for secure operation.

### Snapshots

- Create named snapshots of the filesystem state.
- Restore a snapshot at any time.
- Export and import snapshots to/from JSON files.
- Command-line tools for snapshot management.

### Templates

- Define filesystem structures via YAML or JSON templates.
- Preload directories and files from host filesystem.
- Support for variable substitutions in templates.
- CLI for managing templates (list, view, create, import, export, delete).

### File and Directory Operations

- Standard operations: create, delete, read, write.
- Copy and move files/directories with recursive support.
- Search and find with pattern matching.
- Listing and navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`).

## Installation

Install dependencies appropriate to your environment (e.g., `boto3` for S3 support, `PyYAML` for YAML templates).

For example:

```bash
pip install pyyaml boto3
```

---

## Usage

Example of creating a virtual filesystem with the default in-memory provider and applying a security profile:

```python
from chuk_virtual_fs import VirtualFileSystem

vfs = VirtualFileSystem(provider_name="memory", security_profile="default")

# Create a directory
vfs.mkdir("/home")

# Create and write to a file
vfs.write_file("/home/hello.txt", "Hello, virtual filesystem!")

# Read the file content
content = vfs.read_file("/home/hello.txt")

print(content)  # Output: Hello, virtual filesystem!
```

Snapshots and templates can be managed via provided APIs or CLI tools.

---

## CLI Tools

- `snapshot_cli.py`: Manage snapshots from the command line (list, export, import, delete).
- `template_cli.py`: Manage filesystem templates (list, view, create, import, export, delete).

## Security Considerations and Risks

`chuk_virtual_fs` includes built-in security mechanisms that help mitigate common filesystem security risks; however, users should be aware of the following:

### Implemented Security Measures

- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal (`..`), limits path depth, and controls accessible paths via allowlists and denylists.
- **File Size Limits**: Restricts individual file sizes to configured maximums.
- **Total Storage Quotas**: Limits total storage footprint.
- **Read-Only Modes**: Allows setting the whole filesystem as read-only to prevent modifications.
- **Denied Patterns**: Blocks creation/access to files matching dangerous or forbidden patterns (e.g., executables, hidden files).
- **Violation Logging**: Logs attempts to violate restrictions, such as unauthorized path access or exceeding quotas.
- **Setup Allowed Paths**: Automatically creates allowed paths during initialization to prevent issues when applying restrictions.

### Potential Risks

- **User-Defined Security Profiles**: Custom profiles must be carefully defined â€” incomplete or permissive settings could expose sensitive files or allow unexpected operations.
- **Denial of Service via Quota Exhaustion**: Excessive small files created before quota enforcement might degrade performance.
- **Race Conditions**: In multithreaded scenarios or with asynchronous storage backends, rapid changes around path checks might cause TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) issues.
- **Underlying Provider Vulnerabilities**: Security wrappers depend on the correctness of the wrapped storage providers; bugs or flaws in providers can affect security.
- **Pattern Configuration**: Misconfigured regular expressions in denied patterns may either be too permissive or too restrictive.
- **Sensitive Files Exposure**: Ensure that explicitly sensitive paths (e.g., `/etc/shadow`, `/root`) are correctly denied if they exist on the backend (mostly relevant for providers backed by real filesystems).
- **Logging Sensitivity**: Violation logs should be protected, as they may contain sensitive path information.

### Recommendations to Mitigate Risks

- Use predefined or thoroughly tested security profiles.
- Regularly review security settings and violation logs.
- Use isolated environments when running with "untrusted" profiles.
- Avoid exposing the virtual filesystem to untrusted users without proper access control.
- Keep providers and dependencies updated to avoid exploitation of provider-level vulnerabilities.
- When integrating with external storage (e.g., S3), configure access controls and credentials securely.

# Summary

This project provides a robust, modular virtual filesystem with a focus on flexibility and security. The security wrapper and profiles offer significant protections against common threats, but users must apply sensible configurations and understand the underlying storage providers' capabilities and limitations.
